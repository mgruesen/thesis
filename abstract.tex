Software Defined Networking (SDN) aims to create more powerful, intelligent
networks that are managed using programmed switching devices. Applications
for these SDN switches should be target independent, while being efficiently
translated to the platform's native machine code. However network switch vendors
do not conform to any standard, and contain different capabilities and features
that vary between manufacturers.

The Freeflow Virtual Machine (FFVM) is a modular, fully programmable
virtual switch that can host compiled network applications. Applications are
compiled to native object libraries and dynamically loaded at run time. The
FFVM provides the necessary data and computing resources required by
applications to process packets. This work details the many
implementation approaches investigated and evaluated in order to define a
suitable execution environment for hosted network applications.
