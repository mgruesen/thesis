\section{Background}
\label{intro:bg}
Networking architecture has become the focus of many facets in computing with
an increased reliance on network data. As more and more devices become
connected and users produce and consume data at an ever-increasing rate, the
way we accommodate these needs in networking infrastructure has prompted the
need for change. In order to service the needs of users, network engineers
require more functionality from their equipment than basic switching and
routing. Their networks need to be more intelligent, and allow for more
powerful user generated network applications. Unfortunately conventional
network switching devices are fairly static and rigid, and do not provide the
means to network engineers to create custom applications that suit their
particular needs. A network switch is composed of two high level components, a
control plane and a forwarding, or data, plane. The control plane manages the
configuration and state of the device, as well as compiled application
tenancy; whereas the data plane is responsible for executing forwarding
behavior over network traffic flows in the system. These components are
tightly coupled which hinders how a network application might be able to
abstract their functionality. At the upper level, control plane management is,
more or less, a fairly open entity. Users can configure their networks and
applications running on them within the confines of the interface exposed by
that particular switch vendor. To apply changes made in the control plane,
which may alter the configuration of the data plane, usually the device must
be rebooted. Most changes made to resources used by the data plane and
applications can only occur when the system is starting up. This has much to
do with the fact that the applications running on these devices are created by
the vendors themselves, who understand the underlying architecture in the
system and are able to push the application logic down into the hardware. The
result is high performance networking applications, that utilize hardware
accelerators and are tuned for that particular system. However this comes at a
great cost, flexibility. Network engineers are at the mercy of networking
device manufacturers when they want to mold their network to suit their needs.
The data plane in a network switch remains a black box, with features and
capabilities varying greatly between vendors. This lack of transparency makes
it difficult to model an abstract machine that can be targeted by networking
applications.

Research in the domain of Software Defined Networking (SDN) investigates the
decoupling of the two planes, giving users the ability to create networking
applications that can respond to changes in network traffic flows in real time.
The emphasis in this model is to allow a single control plane to manage 
numerous data planes in one or many switches as a unified entity. Most of the 
work in this field revolves primarily around virtual network switches, 
building on concepts provided by the OpenFlow specification \cite{openflow}. 
We chose to focus on the implementation of a single programmable network 
device, where the control and data plane exist within the same system. This 
allowed us to produce a specification for an abstract machine for networking 
applications. The machine defines memory and object models, program execution 
semantics, a set of required operations, access to guaranteed resources, and 
the types of objects that it operates on and their behaviors. It must also be 
able to support a variety of high level programming languages as well as 
platforms and network processor architectures. Optimization support for 
specialized instruction execution and offloading computation to hardware 
accelerators and/or co-processors is also a key requirement to keep 
performance on par. Languages are able to interact with the virtual machine 
through an application binary interface (ABI), that defines symbols and rules 
that dictate how they can utilize the runtime system. This approach has 
produced an instance of an abstract machine that provides the necessary 
resources and capabilities required to support network application execution.


\section{Goals}
\label{intro:goals}
It is clear that there is need for runtime support for compiled
networking applications. The virtual machine needed to provide functionality
for both parts of a network switch, the control and data planes, and allow
applications to have control and access to these resources at the user level.
In addition to servicing the needs of applications, the runtime needs to be
supported on a variety of architectures and utilize the materialized and 
virtualized resources available.

\section{Contributions}
\label{intro:contrib}
The contributions presented in this thesis come from numerous experiments with
low level networking hardware. These experiments helped characterize the 
problem domain with respect to 

% \subsection{Virtual Machine}
% \label{intro:vm}
% FFVM is a process that provides the resources necessary for network
% applications to execute. These resources are:
%
% \begin{itemize}
% \item \emph{Ports} - The source of I/O for applications.
% \item \emph{Tables} - Matching data structures that define forwarding behavior.
% \item \emph{Packet Context} - Contextual information about a packet.
% \item \emph{Action Exection} - Native FFVM instructions to be executed by the
% runtime.
% \item \emph{Memory} - Packet Context buffers.
% \item \emph{Threading} - Infrastructure for modeling applications in various
% threading architectures.
% \end{itemize}
%
% \subsection{Runtime Support Library}
% \label{intro:rsl}
% Freeflow provides a runtime support library that Steve applications can
% leverage to execute as efficiently as possible. The library houses a collection
% of system calls, exposed as external C functions, to allow applications to call
% into the system during execution. These system calls allow the runtime to map
% the execution of certain instructions to the most appropriate computational
% device present and provide access to guaranteed resources.
