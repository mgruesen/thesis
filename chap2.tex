\chapter{Software Defined Networking}
\label{sdn}
SDN provides a networking device model where the control and data planes are decoupled from one another, where a single control plane is responsible for distributing application execution across a set of network switches viewed as a unified data plane instance. Applications generally operate at the control plane level and rely on distributed platforms, such as OpenVSwitch (OVS) \ref{ovs}, to push the logic down to the hardware level.

\section{Networking Applications}
\label{sdn:apps}
Not all networking applications operate in the same conceptual space, that is, they generally act as a part of a larger system. Applications can operate on a particular traffic flow, a node within a network, or across the entire network.


\section{OpenFlow}
\label{sdn:of}
The OpenFlow model defines a messaging layer that the control and, potentially distributed, data plane(s) can communicate through. This is embodied in the OpenFlow Protocol, which specifies a set of ``instructions'' that the control and data planes must support.
