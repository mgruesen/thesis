\chapter*{ACKNOWLEDGEMENT}

First, I would like to thank Dr. Andrew Sutton for being my advisor and giving
me the opportunity to work as his research assistant during my graduate studies.
I am truly grateful for all that I have learned while working with you.

I would also like to thank my wife and family for their support while pursuing
this degree.

A special thanks goes out to Hoang Nguyen, who developed the Steve programming
language and compiler along side the Freeflow project to provide network applications for hosting.

Lastly I would like to thank the members of Flowgrammable, Jasson Casey, Dr.
Paul Gratz, Dr. Alex Sprintson, and Luke McHale, for being a great research
team to work with.
