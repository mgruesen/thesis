\chapter*{ACKNOWLEDGEMENT}

First, I would like to thank Dr. Andrew Sutton for being my advisor and giving
me the opportunity to work as his research assistant during my graduate studies.
I'm truly grateful for all that I have learned by working with you.

I would also like to thank my wife and family for their support while pursuing
this degree.

A special thanks goes out to Hoang Nguyen who developed the Steve programming
language in tandem with this project.

Lastly I would like to thank the members of Flowgrammable, Jasson Casey, Dr.
Paul Gratz, Dr. Alex Sprintson, and Luke McHale, something...
